    <h1>From the Book: Daring Greatly</h1>

      Going it alone is value we hold in high esteem in our culture, ironically
      even when it comes to cultivatin connection. I get the appeal; I have that
      rugged individualism in my DNA. In fact, one of my very favorite
      break-up-kick-ass-no-one-can-hurt-me songs is Whitesnake' "Here I Go
      Again." If you're a person of a certain age, I'd put money down that
      you've rolled down the window and defiantly sung: "And here I go again on
      my own...Like a drifter I was born to walk alone..."...

        THE STATE'S LATEST CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE BEING HERALDED BY NATION'S

        Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely
        under the control of real estate developers. Construction activities
        have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the
        Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the
        shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent
        decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents,
        especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.

        The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an
        environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded
        when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a
        bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the
        League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and
        environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and
        diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring
        its natural attributes.

        Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has
        been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and
        sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin,
        California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and
        disseminate the water quality information necessary to support
        science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin.
        The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and
        state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set,
        together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality,
        is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to
        develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of
        nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.

        UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe
        Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and
        public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for
        restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it
        produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.
